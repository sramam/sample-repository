## What/why is this?
> I am actively interviewing for senior engineering roles.
> Each interview process tries to establish a base-line in it's own way - some better than others.
>
> I spent considerable time on one of these assignments. I decided to anonymize and adapt the work and share it via github.
> The hope is prospective employers get a preview of my work style and output (and hopefully more üëç and less üëé?!)

## The Challenge
The challenge was to convert a traditional multi-tenant architecture to one that  enables multi-tenant inter-connectivity for a slack-like system.
See this [for a fuller description of the problem](./challenge.md)
