# SampleCompany - Authorization POC

SampleCompany is a service that provides a secure, customized platform
that connect educators with students, saving school districts and
tutoring companies time and tracking student progress automatically.

## Scope of POC

For this POC, we'll implement a simplified take on "Multi-tenant Connectivity"

> SampleCompany is a multi-tenant architecture that is currently in a largez data
> migration and product transition to enable different organizations (i.e. tenants
> in our architecture) to be able to connect and collaborate with each other via
> secure channels in our platform (i.e. enabling co-owned sub-tenants between
> primary tenants in the architecture). For more context of how a similar platform
> accomplished this type of "shared subtenants" architecture, read this blog post
> on the development of Slack Shared Channels.

Our goal is to create the minimal possible POC that validates the authorization
principal described in the "Slack Shared Channels" post:

### Functional Requirements

- There are two categories of people
- One belongs to an Org of some sort.
- The other is an "outsider" who can be invited
- One added to the "Org", they can both access a shared resource

#### Assumptions

Our goal is to demonstrate that only valid roles can add/invite.
We'll skip the invitation flow, and assume `add === accepting invite`.

## Design Document

The design and implementation discussion is captured in [this document](./DESIGN.md)

## Getting started

### Try it on localhost

```
git clone https://github.com/sramam/gsb-oso
npm install
npm test
```

### Quality

You can see the results of this in the [CI builds](https://github.com/sramam/gsb-oso/actions/workflows/ci.yml).
The gist of it is that have 100% coverage.

```bash

```

Please see the [design doc](./DESIGN.md) to understand the
implementation details. You can of course also [read the code](./src/api.test.ts)!

Thank you for reading this far!
